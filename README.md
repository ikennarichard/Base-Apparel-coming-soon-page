### What I learned

__linear gradient/repeating-liner-gradient__ creates a progression of colors, from one side to the other along a straight line. 


__intrinsic vs extrinsic__ intrinsic size refers to the contents natural size, while extrinsic sizing refers to the size set by the user.


__Plain Old Semantic HTML - POSH__

### Continued development

I'll love to keep improving my Programming/JavaScript skills. JS is powerful and easy to learn, but it has a few misleading behaviors. So its important for me to understand it better.
